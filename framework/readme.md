# Framework

This is a framework of feature modules for WordPress that are shared across plugins.

Many of these were refactored from the deprecated [plugin framework v2](https://bitbucket.org/tangibleinc/tangible-plugin-framework).

#### Source code

The framework is developed within the [Template System](https://github.com/tangibleinc/template-system). It is also published as [its own repository](https://github.com/tangibleinc/framework) to support plugins installing it as a Composer module.

# Integrate Design library with WordPress

In the Framework, it would be convenient to bundle the library `@tangible/design`, made of Sass and JavaScript, into independently loadable modules under a shared global namespace.

- `design-core.min.css`
- `design-core.min.js`
- `design-component.*.min.css`
- `design-component.*.min.js`

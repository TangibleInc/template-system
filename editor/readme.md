# Editor

See [Elandel: Editor](/reference/template-system/elandel/editor/).

## Upgrade from CodeMirror 5

The previous version of the editor has been archived to [its own repository](https://github.com/tangibleinc/tangible-codemirror-v5).

The minified bundle is still in the Template System as [Codemirror v5 module](../modules/codemirror-v5/). The old editor can be enabled by plugin setting until the new editor fully replaces it.

# Template System

This is the template system shared by Tangible Blocks and Loops & Logic.

**Source code**: https://github.com/tangibleinc/template-system

**Documentation**: https://docs.loopsandlogic.com/reference/template-system/

## Overview

The codebase is organized by feature areas, which are made up of modules.

- [Language](language/) - Defines the template language and tags
- [Admin](admin/) - Admin features such as template post types, editor, import/export, assets, locations, layouts, builder integrations
- [Framework](framework/) - Features shrared across plugins, such as AJAX, Date, HJSON
- [Modules](modules/) - Additional template system features, such as Chart, Slider, Table
- [Integrations](integrations/) - Features to integrate with third-party plugins

Each module should aim to be generally useful, clarify its dependencies internal and external, and ideally be well-documented and tested. Some are published as a Composer library (PHP) or NPM package (JavaScript).

## Tests

This module comes with a suite of unit and integration tests.

### Requirements

To run the tests, we use [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) to create a local dev and test environment, optionally switching between multiple PHP versions.

Please note that `wp-env` requires Docker to be installed. There are instructions available for installing Docker on [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).

If you're on Windows, you might have to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to run the tests (see [this comment](https://bitbucket.org/tangibleinc/tangible-fields-module/pull-requests/30#comment-389568162)).

### Prepare

Install dependencies by running the following in the project directory. 

```sh
npm install
```

Install PHPUnit.

```sh
composer install --dev
```

### Run tests

This repository includes NPM scripts to run the tests with PHP versions 8.2 and 7.4.

**Note**: We need to maintain compatibility with PHP 7.4, as WordPress itself only has beta support for PHP 8.x. See [PHP Compatibility and WordPress versions](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/php-compatibility-and-wordpress-versions/) and [Usage Statistics](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/).

First, run tests using a specific PHP version. This will tell `wp-env` to install it.

```sh
npm run env:test:8.2
```

The version-specific command takes a while to start, but afterwards you can run the following to re-run tests in the same environment.

```sh
npm run env:test
```

To switch the PHP version, run a different version-specific command.

```sh
npm run env:test:7.4
```

To stop the Docker process:

```sh
npm run env:stop
```

Usually it's enough to run `env:start` and `env:stop`. To completely remove the created Docker images and remove cache:

```sh
npm run env:destroy
```

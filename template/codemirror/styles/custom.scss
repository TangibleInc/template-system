 * The only reason it's possible to use the root class name .tangible-codemirror
 * is that we forked CodeMirror to add the unique class upon creating the editor.
 *
 * Otherwise, if we add the class after creation, it causes styling issues (with
 * gutter, line number, cursor, etc.) because of style calculations that CodeMirror
 * performs immediately after editor is created.

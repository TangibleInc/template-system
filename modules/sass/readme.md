# Sass

Compile [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to CSS.

- Based on [SCSS-PHP](https://github.com/scssphp/scssphp/) 1.12.1
- To upgrade:
  - Copy `src` folder and rename as `scssphp`
  - Run the script `replace-namespace.sh` to use unique namescape in all files, in case other plugins are using a different version of SCSS-PHP

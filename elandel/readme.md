# Elandel

Elandel is a template language and ecosystem for authoring hypermedia documents on the web. It extends the HTML and CSS syntax with loops, logic, and dynamic content.

The language is implemented in TypeScript, and runs in the browser or on a server-side JavaScript runtime. It is extensible with additional features, such as charts, diagrams, musical blocks.

Its goal is to be suitable for:

- Static site generation
- Local-first web authoring environment
- Integration with WordPress, Node/Bun, MySQL/SQLite
- Networking and portability between sites and servers
- [Computational notebooks](https://maggieappleton.com/computational-notebooks) - Shareable, browser-based documents that can run code
